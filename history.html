<h1>History</h1>
<p>The idea of ASD And Me was created by <b><i><u>Ben Howkins</u></i></b> in 2019 shortly after finishing an NHS course to inprove his social skills, with the plan to use the skills he had learnt to help other sufferers of these conditions who weres in a similar boat as him but didn't have access to the same resources he did. A Facebook page witha intro podcast were created with the plans to make this into a full series once life permitted him to.
